## Key Points
This is the first day students will be coding along and on their own with new content on HTML tags.

- 👋 Welcome & Do Now (5) : 
    -  Students will edit the content with some HTML tags. This may be completely new to students, but they should follow the intructions provided. It's okay to make mistakes! <br><br>

- </> HTML Tags (10) : 
    - The lead teacher will explain the purpose of HTML and the structure/syntax of making an HTML tag.<br><br>

- 💻 Code Along (5)
    - In this Code Along, the teacher will demo how to make adjust the tags on the webpage. Do this as a Think Aloud. In other words, briefly model it for them (without asking for input) while narrating your thinking as you’re making the changes. Make sure students are coding as you are! <br><br>

- 💻 Code Solo (20)
    - Give students some time to try making tags by themselves. <br><br>

- 👋 Exit Ticket & Closing (5)


## Common Misconceptions
The syntax might be tricky for students, especially if they’ve never coded before. Make sure they’re coding along with you during the Code Along so they have examples to work off of when they’re practicing by themselves. Because the starter code has code prewritten, students might be confused about exactly where to write. Remind them to read the comments which indicate where they should start writing their code.
