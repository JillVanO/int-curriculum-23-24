## Key Points

🗣️ Do Now & Share Outs (7) :
- Engage students and set a positive tone for the lesson.
- Start with a discussion on arrays.
- Guide students to modify arrays and share their findings.<br><br>

➰ forEach Loops (15) :
- Explain the concept and syntax of forEach loops.
- Discuss how forEach loops are used for iterating over arrays.
- Provide examples to illustrate forEach loops in action.<br><br>

🔥 Rapid Questions (3) : 
- Quick Review: Pose rapid-fire questions to reinforce key concepts.<br><br>

💻 Code Along (15) : 
- Lead a coding session where students apply forEach loops in real scenarios.
- Encourage students to try out examples and variations.
- For the third task (finding the sum), talk through the logic with the students if they struggle.
  - "We need to update the sum each time."
  - "Sum is already declared, so we can take that variable and equal it to a new value."
  - "The new value should be whatever the sum is plus the new number we want to add."
  - "What would that code look like?"<br><br>

👋 Exit Ticket & Closing (5)
- Direct students to the Exit Ticket in Google Classroom, ensuring all questions are answered.
- Summarize key takeaways, remind students to submit the exit ticket, and provide any closing remarks.<br><br>
